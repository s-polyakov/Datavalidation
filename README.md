Let's say you have to implement one method with the following signature:

from typing import Dict
from pandas import Series

def validate_dict(str, data: Dict[str, Series]) -> bool:
Method should return True if all dictionary items are of the same length, and False otherwise.

Method is a part of library that other developers import to ensure that input is correct.

Q: what is purpose of the first parameter called 'str'?
